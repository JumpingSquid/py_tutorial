# py_tutorial
repository for Python class

Introduction
============
This is the repo of the jupyter notebook file and data for Python tutorial at Donz. The goal of this class
is to help student understand the basic tools for data analytics with Python. We will go through four examples in this class:
+ Basic Python syntax
+ Pandas and NumPy
+ Matplotlib
+ Scikit-Learn

Prerequisite
------------
Beforing going into the tutorial, one should install the required package. As described above, in this class we will practice pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. There are many ways to install these packages, choose one from the following methods.

+ Anaconda <br />
Anaconda is a comprehensive python platform specifically designed for data analysis. One can find almost all common packages in it.
However, this also implies its size will be quite large. For the beginner, it is strongly recommended to install Anaconda. <br />
