# Python tutorial
repository for Python class

Introduction
------------
This is the repo of the jupyter notebook file and dataset for Python tutorial at Donz. The goal of this class
is to help students understand the basic tools for data analytics using Python. We will go through four examples in this class:
+ Basic Python syntax and object
+ Pandas and NumPy
+ Matplotlib
+ Scikit-Learn

Prerequisite
------------
Beforing going into the tutorial, one should install the required packages. As described above, in this class we will practice pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. And all the demo and practice will be performed on Jupyter Notebook, an interactive computing environment. There are many ways to install these packages, choose one from below methods.

+ Anaconda (Python 3.7)<br/>
Anaconda is a comprehensive python platform specifically designed for data science. It includes Python and other packages. One can find almost all common packages in it. For the beginner, it is strongly recommended to install Anaconda at the first time. <br/>
Download link: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ <br/>
Installation reference: https://medium.com/python4u/anaconda%E4%BB%8B%E7%B4%B9%E5%8F%8A%E5%AE%89%E8%A3%9D%E6%95%99%E5%AD%B8-f7dae6454ab6 <br />

+ Python 3.7 with pip <br/>
If you are familiar with Python and cmd(Windows)/terminal(Mac), you can install Python 3.7 first, and enter following commands in cmd(Windows)/terminal(Mac):
<pre><code>
  pip install jupyter
  pip install pandas
  pip install numpy
  pip install scikit-learn
  pip install matplotlib</code></pre>

+ Google Colab <br/>
Google colab is an online programming platform based on Jupyter notebook. The user can directly do coding in the browser without installing Python or any packages in local. Please use Google Colab only if all two methods above do not work for you.<br/>
